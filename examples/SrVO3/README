This is an example of how to prepare input data for UQcRPA using the benchmark
material SrVO3. Note: semiconductors require a slightly different treatment
involving a q-shift - see BerkeleyGW's silicon example for details.
Also added simple run script for UQcRPA.

================================================================================

Get started:

1. Install the required packages.
  - Quantum ESPRESSO (6.0)
  - wannier90 (2.1.0)
  - BerkeleyGW (1.2.0)
This example assumes ESPRESSO is installed in PARALLEL, and that all executable
directories have been added to $PATH.

2. READ EACH SCRIPT CAREFULLY and change them to suit your architecture. Then,
run them in the order indicated (starting in the ESPRESSO directory).

3. Copy the files described in the UQcRPA README into a single directory. Note:
MATLAB may have issues with ln -s.

4. Set the location of the directory (datadir) in run.m and run the UQcRPA
calculation.
